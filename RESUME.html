<h3> ABOUT ME </h3>
<article>
<p> My name's Connor. I was born in the <abbr> USA </abbr> (United States). I'm a <strong> computer science major </strong>, currently in my freshman year of college. I've been learning to code over the last few weeks and have really enjoyed it.
I'm interested in not only the software of computers, but the hardware as well. Computers have always interested me.
Maybe it's because I really enjoy video games, and those are played on computers. I would like to learn how to code video games, but I think I shouldn't learn too
many languages at once. It's probably better to take it slow my first few years of computer science.  
<br> <br>I'm also a big fan of Basketball and Football.
Football season has started back up, so I'm busy on Mondays, Thursdays, Saturdays, <em>AND</em> Sundays!
I always forget just how much of my time<small> watching Football takes up</small> until the s<wbr>-eason starts back up and I'm staying up into the early hours of the morning to finish an assignment <i> due 
that day! </i> </article>
